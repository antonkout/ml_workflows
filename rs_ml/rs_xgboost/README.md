# Data Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This data analysis pipeline is designed for feature reduction and classification tasks. It incorporates T-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), PCA (Principal Component Analysis), grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and the XGBoost Classifier.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset in a compatible format (e.g., pandas DataFrame) and split it into features (X) and labels (y).

- Feature Reduction: The pipeline provides two options for feature reduction: T-SNE and PCA. Choose the method that suits your data and uncomment the corresponding section in the script.
- Grid Search: Tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost Classifier using grid search. Modify the parameter grid in the script to match your requirements.
- Training: Train the XGBoost Classifier with the selected hyperparameters.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- Visualization: Visualize the results, such as the reduced-dimensional representations from T-SNE or PCA.
